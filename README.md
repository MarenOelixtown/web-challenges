🌱 At the beginning, I learned the basics of programming: HTML and CSS. Our coaches showed me how to build a static website and I learned about semantic and accessible HTML.

🎨 From week 2 onwards, the programming course was all about website styling: there was a wealth of knowledge about modern techniques such as Flexbox, Grid and much more. 

🔥 From the third and fourth week of the web developer bootcamp, the basics of JavaScript were added. Using the latest and most modern programming language techniques, the foundation for React - the library - was laid. In combination with the Next.js framework, which offers building blocks for creating fast web applications, I was able to learn from practical application examples for routing, data retrieval and infrastructure.

↕️ This was followed by the task of linking the backend and frontend. I learned how to program my own API that connects to databases, in our case MongoDB, to forward information from the server to the frontend. 

🚀 In the last part of the eight weeks, I was introduced to digital product development using agile methods with my peers. We are now using SCRUM to plan our ideas, structure them and package them in productive "sprints" for our four-week final project, which will be carried out as a teamwork.
